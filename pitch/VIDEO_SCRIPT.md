### [SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM] ⏱️ 0:00 - 0:20

> "Every 15 days, travel agencies face a silent killer: the BSP payment deadline.
> 
> They owe airlines fifty thousand dollars TODAY... but their customers won't pay 
> for another 45 days.
> 
> Banks take 30 days to approve a loan. By then? The agency is already suspended.
> 
> **54% of travel agency bankruptcies are caused by this cash flow mismatch.**"

### [SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION] ⏱️ 0:20 - 0:40

> "Introducing Amadeus Liquidity Agent: your autonomous CFO that never sleeps.
>
> Our AI agent continuously monitors your BSP debt versus your future bookings.
>
> When it detects a liquidity crisis—72 hours before your deadline—it automatically 
> requests a DeFi flash loan, using YOUR OWN confirmed ticket sales as collateral.
>
> **No banks. No paperwork. Thirty seconds, not thirty days.**"

---

### [SLIDE 3: DEMO / UI MOCKUP] ⏱️ 0:40 - 1:05

> "Here's how it works in practice.
>
> The dashboard shows your agency owes fifty thousand to BSP, due in 3 days.
> But you only have eight thousand in cash.
>
> The agent scans your Amadeus bookings and finds sixty-five thousand in confirmed 
> future sales—that's 130% collateral coverage.
>
> Risk score: LOW. And with one click—or fully automated—the loan executes.
>
> **USDC hits your wallet in under a minute. Crisis averted.**"

---

### [SLIDE 4: ARCHITECTURE] ⏱️ 1:05 - 1:25

> "Under the hood, we leverage the Amadeus Network's unique infrastructure.
>
> Real-time booking data flows from the Amadeus GDS into our Oracle.
>
> The Nova Agent—running on Amadeus Runtime—evaluates risk using WASM modules 
> that parse complex travel JSON efficiently.
>
> It then generates a cryptographic State Proof that validates your solvency 
> WITHOUT exposing passenger data—fully GDPR compliant.
>
> That proof triggers the LiquidityVault smart contract to disburse funds."

---

### [SLIDE 5: AMADEUS INTEGRATION] ⏱️ 1:25 - 1:45

> "Why Amadeus is essential:
>
> First, Nova Runtime lets us process complex GDS data that would be too expensive 
> on a traditional EVM chain.
>
> Second, State Proofs give DeFi protocols cryptographic trust in travel collateral.
>
> Third, our risk model dynamically adjusts rates based on real-time flight data—
> if a flight cancels, collateral value updates instantly.
>
> **This is only possible with Amadeus infrastructure.**"

---

### [SLIDE 6: MARKET & CLOSE] ⏱️ 1:45 - 2:00

> "The travel agency BSP market is 88 billion dollars annually. 
> We're targeting 1% of that—starting with Chile and Argentina.
>
> We've built the architecture, the smart contracts, and the risk model—
> all during this hackathon.
>
> **Amadeus Liquidity Agent: Because no agency should die waiting for a bank.**
>
> Thank you."
